# Deep Learning Project - LSTM Text Generation

This project focuses on text generation using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The model is trained on **Pride and Prejudice** by Jane Austen, and it generates text based on an input sequence of words. The goal is to predict the next word in a sequence, allowing for the generation of coherent text passages.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle: [Pride and Prejudice Subtitles and Text Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theeranartmeesathien/pride-prejudice-subtitles-and-text). You can use any file from this dataset for training the model.
